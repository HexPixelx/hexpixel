At the heart of the marketplace is our in-game currency, "[Pixel](../pixel-token.md)", which will be used for everything from trading in game items, to purchasing from the marketplace, and everything in-between. The "Pixel" marketplace is designed to give players a new level of control and flexibility over their in-game economies, allowing them to earn and spend "Pixel" in a variety of ways.

[The DAO](../../dao.md) (decentralized autonomous organization) and governance council are important aspects of the "[Pixel](../pixel-token.md)" marketplace. The DAO will be in charge of overseeing the "Pixel" economy as well as ensuring fairness and good game administration. The governing council, comprised of elected players, will have the authority to make decisions on the "Pixel" economy and propose changes to the DAO. This gives players a genuine say in how the game is handled while also ensuring that the economy remains fair and balanced for all players.

In addition to earning "Pixel" through gameplay and in-game activities, players will also be able to purchase "Pixel" on the open market, giving them even more flexibility and control over their in-game economies. The marketplace will also feature a wide range of items and goods, from rare and unique in-game items to special bonuses and rewards.

With the introduction of "Pixel" and the marketplace system, we are taking the first steps towards unlocking the true potential of in-game economies and giving players more control and flexibility over their gaming experiences. So come join us in the world of Hex Pixel, where the possibilities are endless and the adventure never ends.
