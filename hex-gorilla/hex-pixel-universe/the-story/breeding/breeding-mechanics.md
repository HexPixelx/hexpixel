# üë©‚ù§üíãüë® Breeding Mechanics

In Hex Pixel, the breeding system is an important feature of the game that allows players to build unique and strong creatures. Players can build offspring that inherit particular features from both parents as well as new, unique traits that can be used to create a variety of different creatures by merging two parent animals.

The method used to determine an offspring's qualities is based on a mix of each parent's genome and the hue of the parent creatures. A creature's genome is made up of a series of genes that define the creature's qualities, such as size, strength, and talents. The color of a creature also influences the qualities of its offspring, as different hues are related to distinct genetic traits.

The game use a combination of [Mendelian genetics](../../../../readme/learn/mendelian-genetics/) and [color genetics](../../../../readme/learn/mendelian-genetics/color-genetics.md) to determine the specific traits of an offspring. Mendelian genetics is a well-established branch of genetics that studies the transmission of traits from parents to children. According to the fundamental principles of Mendelian genetics, each trait is determined by a gene that might be dominant or recessive. Dominant genes are always expressed in offspring, but recessive genes are expressed only if both parents have the same recessive gene.

Hex Pixel employs a distinct color genetics approach in addition to Mendelian genetics. Each hue in this system is associated with a unique set of hereditary features. A red creature, for example, may be more likely to inherit features linked to strength and speed, whereas a blue creature may be more likely to inherit traits associated to intelligence and agility.

The game employs a sophisticated mathematical technique to merge the Mendelian genetics and color genetics systems. To identify the specific qualities of the offspring, this algorithm takes into account the individual genes of each parent as well as the color of each parent. The formula is written as follows:

[`Offspring Traits = (Parent 1 Genes x Parent 2 Genes) + (Parent 1 Color x Parent 2 Color)`](#user-content-fn-1)[^1]

The game also includes a one-of-a-kind chart method to display the prospective traits of the children based on the parent species' DNA and color. This picture is divided into pieces, each representing a different trait or set of features. This chart helps players assess the likelihood of various species' breeding outcomes and plan their breeding strategy accordingly.

Hex Pixel employs a distinct genome system in addition to Mendelian genetics and color genetics. A creature's genome is made up of a series of genes that define the creature's qualities, such as size, strength, and talents. Each gene can be dominant or recessive, and it can be passed down from either parent. A creature's genome is unique, which means that each organism has its own genome.

The breeding method and formula used by Hex Pixel are a one-of-a-kind and complex system that allows for a diverse range of creatures and qualities. By mixing Mendelian genetics, color genetics, and genome genetics, players can create a wide range of animals and explore the game's unlimited possibilities.

[^1]: Hex Pixel is a virtual world where the characters are creatures with unique genomes and color genetics. The game incorporates both Mendelian genetics and color genetics in determining the traits and appearance of these creatures.

    Mendelian genetics refers to the laws and principles that describe the inheritance of traits from parents to offspring. These laws were first described by Gregor Mendel in the 19th century, and they form the basis of modern genetics. In Hex Pixel, the Mendelian genetics system is used to determine the genome traits of creatures, such as the number of legs, shape of the tail, and so on.

    Color genetics, on the other hand, is the study of how color is inherited from parents to offspring. In Hex Pixel, color genetics determines the color pattern of the creatures. The game incorporates a system of dominant and recessive genes, just like Mendelian genetics, which determine the color of the creatures.

    When two creatures breed in Hex Pixel, the game uses both Mendelian and color genetics to determine the traits and appearance of the offspring. The traits of the parents are combined to form a unique genome for the offspring, and the color of the offspring is determined by the combination of the color genes of the parents.

    In summary, Hex Pixel uses both Mendelian genetics and color genetics to create a rich and diverse virtual world where each creature is unique and has its own set of traits and appearance. This system makes the game more engaging and provides players with a true sense of ownership over their creatures.
