As you advance through the game, you will be able to delve deeper into the mysteries of the Elementals. By earning experience points through various quests, challenges, and battles, you'll not only strengthen your characters, but also unlock the hidden depths of their elemental nature. As your characters grow, they will gain access to new elemental abilities, enabling them to summon flames, manipulate water, shape the earth, or soar through the skies.

Unlocking the full potential of your elemental characters requires a delicate balance between training and bonding with the elements. Engage in specialized training sessions to hone your characters' control over their elemental powers. Through immersive quests and encounters, you'll uncover ancient knowledge and secrets that will enable your characters to wield their element with greater finesse and raw power.
