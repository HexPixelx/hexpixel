# ðŸª™ Pixel Token

Introducing "Pixel,"  the unique in-game currency of Hex Pixel. Pixel is the backbone of the game's economy, used for everything from trading in-game items to purchasing from the marketplace. Players will earn pixels by completing adventures, participating in PVP battles, and breeding their NFTs.

One of the key features of Pixel is that it is governed by a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), which ensures fairness and proper game management. The DAO is made up of a governance council composed of players who are elected by the community. The council is responsible for making important decisions about the game, including setting the exchange rate for Pixel and managing the marketplace.

The use of a DAO and Pixel not only improves the game's transparency and fairness, but it also gives players genuine ownership of their in-game currency. This means that players will be able to hold, trade, and use Pixel outside of the game, allowing them to explore new possibilities.

Players will be able to use Pixel to purchase in-game items, such as weapons, armor, and potions, from the marketplace. They can also use it to purchase special adventures or to enter PVP battles. Additionally, Pixel can be used to bid on exclusive NFTs that are up for auction.

In short, Pixel is an integral part of the Hex Pixel experience, providing players with a new level of ownership and control over their in-game economy. With a DAO and governance council in place, players can feel confident that their Pixel is safe, secure, and being used fairly. The use of Pixel and the DAO is one of the many ways that Hex Pixel is shaking up the world of gaming and Web3.
